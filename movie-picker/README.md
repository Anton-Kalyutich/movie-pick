# Movie::Picker

This gem pulls information from https://suggestmemovie.com/, and puts out a list of 3 movies to pick from.
The user then inouts the number of the movie for more information, goes back to the list or types 'done' to exit the program.
The mission: when you can't choose what movie to watch next, random pick can simplify things.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'movie-picker'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install movie-picker

## Usage

The program starts with greeting the user and listing 3 randomly picked movies. Upon entering the number of the movie in the list the user can see detailed information about the movie, and then either pick another movie from the list, get the whole list again, or enter 'done' to exit the program. The gems says 'goodbye' upon exiting.
